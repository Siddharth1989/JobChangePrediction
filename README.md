# JobChangePrediction
This project aims to create a classifier that can predict whether or not a candidate will change their job by using historical data on candidate demographics and details about their education and experience using different classification machine learning models.
The Final pipeline is our novel solution to implement the requirements of this project. The other code files showcase our work leading up to the final pipeline.
Please refer to the README.PDF for a stepwise guide to implement the final pipeline.
